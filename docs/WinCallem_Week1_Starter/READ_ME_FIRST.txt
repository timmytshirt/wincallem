Welcome to WinCallem!

This folder (and the zip it came from) is your Week 1 Starter Package.
It contains everything you need:

1) WinCallem_Welcome.pdf       → Big picture vision + 6-week roadmap
2) WinCallem_Checklist.pdf     → Week 1 checklist with boxes to tick off
3) StepZero_Guide.pdf          → Beginner setup guide (Windows + Mac)
4) README.md                   → Repo starter README
5) /docs/STEP_ZERO.md          → Setup guide in Markdown (for the repo)
6) /docs/Setup_Log_Template.md → Blank log for you to document your setup

IMPORTANT – ChatGPT Instructions
If you get stuck, upload these PDFs/Markdown files to your ChatGPT Pro account.
That way ChatGPT will see the same instructions we’re all using.
Whenever Tim sends an updated package, use the new version and overwrite the old one.

Week 1 Goal (by Sunday):
• Run the project locally (backend + frontend)
• Test the dashboard: Ping API, Fetch Odds, Run Model Job
• Document your setup in your own Setup Log
• Make one small contribution (doc edit or tiny UI tweak)
